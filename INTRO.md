# Design Patterns for Vue.js - a test driven approach to maintainable applications

## Introduction

You know how to code. You know Vue. You know (or, you know you should) be testing your applications. You install a test runner, Vue Test Utils... and realize you have no idea what do to next.

This is a book about testing. But it's also more. Knowing how to test is not really about learning a test runner, or reading documentation. Testing starts *before* you even start writing code. Testing is a philosophy. It's a way of life. Finally, as engineers, writing test is your *job*. 

My goal is to get you in the habit of writing testable code. The first thing you think when you hear a new business requirement or request should be "*how am I going to write my code in a testable, loosely coupled fashion?*"

The lessons and patterns I'll be sharing are not Vue-specific at all; they are framework agnostic. I'd even say that they are language agnostic; they are fundamental concepts you can take with you and apply them to any software design problem. Good developers focus on tools and frameworks, great developers focus on data structures and how they interact with each other, testability and maintainability.

## The Book

Most books that teach you frameworks, languages or testing will be an app or two, incrementally adding new features. This works great for learning a new language or framework, but isn't ideal for focusing on concepts or ideas. In this book, each section will be focused on a single idea. This has a few benefits; you can read the content is any order, and use it as a kind of reference.

We start of with some patterns for `props`, as well as a discussion around one of the most fundamental ideas in this book, *separation of concerns*. We proceed to cover a wide variety of design patterns for events, forms, components, and everything else you'll need to know to create well engineered Vue.js applications.

Each each is independant; you don't need to read it in order, so if there is a particular section you are interested in, feel free to skip to it. Try to think of this book as a reference tool; I hope it is something you can come back to for years to come and learn something useful each time.
